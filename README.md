#### Description:
## The purpose of the project
My father works as an instructor of a driving school company, so, I created this website thiking in an online booking system. Where the user can scheduale or delete their classes through the website, and the instructor can delete classes and restrict some times. To improve the company and the rate of customers passing the driving test, I created a specific schema on my database to analyse what can be improve.
## About the project
This project is a booking system with login, register, database, cryptography, users type and forms system. I used those libraries:
- Flask: The main library to run the aplication.
- Flask_login: The extension of flask to management the users sessions.
- Flask_wtf: The extension of flask to create forms on html pages, and recive the data on the routes.
- Bcrypt: The library to cryptography users's passwords and check them when the user log in.
- SQLAlchemy: The library to management the database and the connection with my database on MySQL.
- Os and dotenv: Those libraries I used to get the connection with my database and the secret key that are in another folder.
- Datetime: The library that did the logic of days and time of the scheduale.
